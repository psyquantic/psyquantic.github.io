# acting at the speed of thought

it's natural to try to always do the best thing  
but it's also the best way to do nothing  

examples:
- having a thought worth expressing, but no time to do it justice
- having a model that is useful, but no time to make it right
- having a fun idea, but no time to make it good

whenever that happens, we're faced with two choices
1. do nothing
1. do something, but drop it halfway because its time is up

frustrating!
you now have a thought that is half expressed and not useful to anyone.
a bunch of scribblings trying to make your model right, which will find their way to the trash someday.
a nice setup for your idea but no motivation left to actually do it.

actually there is another choice

3. ~~stop having adhd~~ do the thing. just quicker

to do things quicker, you can either satisfy yourself with worse, satisfy yourself with simpler, or deliberately optimize for speed (which often boils down to the tools you use)

i wanted to develop these but i spent long enough on this post for the time being.
i tell myself i will come back to this half finished post one day to actually do it, but i also know it is empirically unlikely.
but at least these ideas are out there, and leaving you (me?) here is the best way to make you think about them, and eventually carry them through.

how do you cope with too many ideas for too few results?
