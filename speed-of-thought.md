# the speed of thought

## when actions cannot keep up

it is natural to try to always do the best thing  
but it is also the best way to do nothing  

examples:
- having a thought worth expressing, but no time to do it justice
- having a model that is useful, but no time to make it right
- having a fun idea, but no time to make it good

whenever that happens, we are faced with two choices
1. do nothing
1. do something, but drop it halfway because its time is up

frustrating!
you now have a thought that is half expressed and not useful to anyone.
a bunch of scribblings trying to make your model right, which will find their way to the trash someday.
a nice setup for your idea but no motivation left to actually do it.

actually there is another choice

3. ~~stop having adhd~~ do the thing. just quicker

to do things quicker, you can either satisfy yourself with worse, satisfy yourself with less, or deliberately optimize for speed

## pause and think

how do _you_ cope with too many ideas for too few results?

## achieving speed of thought

### concepts

- anonymity — share on interests, not egos
- spontaneity — can you achieve a leap right after you figured how?
- breadth — structured multitasking 
- clarity — know where you are going
- determination — prioritize goals, rank on impact, say no often
- extensibility — can you jump back in? add and not restart?
- intemporality — you will not go back to something stale
- alignement — two birds with one stone rather than spreading thin
- commitment — switch only on big pain (absolute & relative to alts)
- reflection — keep the important on the surface
- terseness — most ideas do not need their book (written or read)
- minimalism — silence beats noise
- simplicity — lower the denominator or impact-over-effort

### in practice

- pick your tools — [try and cull](try-liberally-keep-conservatively.md); durable; reusable; [composable](http://widgetsandshit.com/teddziuba/2010/10/taco-bell-programming.html)
- review — reflect, compile, ajust
- reuse — and pay starts from scratch with migrations
